    "# Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "__Original notebook is available here:__ https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/transfer-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "If you took the [Computer Vision course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision), you learned how to use a model to make predictions. But what if you have a new use-case, and you don’t categorize images in exactly the same way as the categories for your original model?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I might want a model that can tell if a photo was taken in an urban area or a rural area, but my original model doesn’t classify images into those two specific categories.  I could build a new model from scratch for this specific purpose. But to get good results, I’d need thousands of photos with labels for which are urban and which are rural.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method called transfer learning will give good results with far less data. Transfer learning takes what a model learned while solving one problem (called a **pre-trained model**, because the model has already been trained on a different dataset), and applies it to a new application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goal of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "[ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet) is a very large image dataset, composed of over 14 million images from thousands of categories.  Keras makes available several models that have been pre-trained on this dataset [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/).  One of the models is [ResNet](https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/#resnet50-function).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll show you how to adapt the pre-trained ResNet model to a new task to predict if an image is rural or urban.  You'll work with [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/urban-and-rural-photos).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that early layers of a deep learning model identify simple shapes. Later layers identify more complex visual patterns, like roads, buildings, windows, and open fields. These layers will be useful in our new application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdcEZhf.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The very last layer makes predictions.  We’ll drop in a replacement for this last layer of the ResNet model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The replacement is a dense layer with two nodes. One node captures how urban the photo is, and the other captures how rural it is. In theory, any node in the last layer before prediction might inform how urban it is. So the urban measure can depend on all the nodes in this layer.  We draw connections to show that possible relationship.  For the same reason, the information at each node might affect our measure of how rural the photo is.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZsJWiDV.png\" width=350px>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a lot of connections here, and we’ll use training data to determine which nodes suggest an image is urban, which suggest it is rural, and which don’t matter.  That is, we’re going to be training the last layer of the model. In practice, that training data will be photos that are labeled as either rural or urban.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When classifying something into only 2 categories, we could get by with only one node at the output.  In this case, a prediction for how urban a photo is would also be a measure of how rural it is.  If a photo is 80% likely to be urban, it would be 20% likely to be rural. But we’ve kept two separate nodes at the output layer.  Using a separate node for each possible category in the output layer will help us transition to cases when we want to predict with more than 2 categories."

    "In this application, we classify photos into 2 categories or classes, urban and rural. We’ll save that as `num_classes`.\n",

    "Next we build the model. We set up a sequential model that we can add layers to. First we add a pre-trained ResNet model. When creating the ResNet model, we’ve written `include_top=False`. This is how we specify that we want to exclude the last layer of the ResNet model that makes predictions.  We’ll also use a file that doesn’t include the weights for that layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument `pooling='avg'` says that if we had extra channels in our tensor at the end of this step, we want to collapse them to a 1D tensor by taking an average.  Now we have a pretrained model that creates the layer you saw in the graphic.  We’ll add a `Dense` layer to make predictions.  We specify the number of nodes in this layer, which in this case is the number of classes. Then we apply the softmax function to produce probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RutdkVs.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll tell TensorFlow not to train the first layer of the sequential model, the ResNet50 layers. This is because that’s the model that was already pre-trained with the ImageNet data. \n"
